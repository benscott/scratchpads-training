Import literature
=================

You can import a variety of reference data into your Scratchpad, including:

- :term:`BibTex`
- Endnote XML
- MARC
- Pubmed ID List
- Pubmed XML
- RIS

1. Click *Import* in the :term:`Admin menu` and select “Nodes: Biblio file
   import”.

2. Browse for the file and select the FILE TYPE.

   .. only:: training

        An example Endnote XML file *Biblio-EndNote8.xml* is included in our :ref:`training-material`.

        Please select "Endnote XML" as the *File type* because our bibliography has been exported from Endnote into XML format.

3. Import.

4. Once the import has completed, a status message will show how many literature records have been created.

5. To view the literature references, in the :term:`Admin menu` go to *Content > Biblio > View*


Troubleshooting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the new records are missing when you click on *Literature* in the :term:`Main menu` please give the system a few minuted to catch up. It needs to index all the new new references which can take a little time.
