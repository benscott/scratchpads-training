Tagging references with taxonomic terms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Scratchpads can tag imported references with taxonomic terms while
importing them. To use this functionality you’ll have to have the
taxonomic names you wish to tag each reference as keywords of the
references. Note that the terms should already exist in your taxonomy.
