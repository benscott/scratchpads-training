Edit content
============

Content can either be edited by going to the respective node and
clicking on the `Edit node`_ tab or by using the `Grid editor`_ to update
several nodes at once.

Edit node
---------

1. When viewing any editable :term:`Node`, an *Edit* tab will be available.

Bulk operations
---------------

1. Within :term:`Admin menu`, select *Content*

2. Next to the content type, click *View* link.

3. This page lists all the content of that particular type. At the top of the page you can apply filters to search for particular items of content.

4. Under *Operations* you can select an action to run against these nodes, including:

    - Change the author of content
    - Delete item
    - Make content sticky
    - Make content unsticky
    - Modify entity values
    - Remove content from front page
    - Unpublish content

Grid editor
-----------

1. Click *Content* in the :term:`Admin menu`

2. Click *Grid* next to the :term:`content type` you wish to edit

3. You will see a matrix with a row for each node and columns for
   selected fields of this content type. The rows are ordered
   chronologically, with the most recent nodes at the top

4. If the fields of the respective content type are sorted into groups
   on different tabs, these tabs will show in the grid editor, too. To
   gain more space for viewing a certain column the column sizes can be
   adapted by moving the column separators or by hiding columns by right
   clicking on the column header and deselecting columns.

5. To edit contents of a single cell click into the cell, edit and click
   *Save*

6. To edit the same field in several nodes, select the respective nodes
   by checking the box to the left of the row. Then click into the cell
   you want to edit for one of the nodes, edit and click *Save*. The
   content of this field will change for all selected nodes

7. To filter for certain content click on the little magnifying glass in
   the upper right corner of the matrix and enter the search word in the
   search box that appears for each column. You can sort the rows by
   clicking on the column header of the field you want to sort by.

8. At the bottom of the matrix there are icons for cloning (creating a
   duplicate entry), deleting and undoing.
