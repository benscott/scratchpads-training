Revisions
=========

*Scratchpads can keep track of the changes made to a node of a content
type. These changes are stored as different versions of the node called
revisions. Revisions can be very useful when data are updated by
different authors.*

Enabling Revisions for content types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. From the *Admin bar* go to *Structure > Content types*
2. Click *Edit* next to the content type you wish to enable or disable
   revisions for
3. Click on *Publishing options* and select *Create new revision*
4. Click *Save Content type* 

If *Create new revision* is specified for a content type, every edit will, by default, create a new version of the page. 

This can be overridden in the *Revision information* on a node - along with setting a more informative revision log message.

Comparing Revisions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you have created a new revision of a node in the content type you
can compare their differences:

1. Locate and view the node you wish to see the revisions for.

2. Click on *Revisions* tab

3. Select the revisions you wish to compare and click *Compare*

Note: If a field accepts HTML input, it might be easiest to view changed without HTML tags - to remove the HTML tags click on *Marked down*
