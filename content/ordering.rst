Ordering content
================

There are two methods to control the order of nodes. `Weight`_ allows
you to specify a weight for each node, so those with a lesser (lighter)
weight float to the top of lists.  The `Sticky at top of lists`_ setting
is a simpler setting, where nodes can be 'promoted' to the top of a list*


Weight
------

Weight settings allow you to finely control the order of content.
For example, if you have many taxon descriptions, you may want to
control the order that they appear on the *Descriptions* tab on a taxon
page.


Enable Weight
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. From the :term:`Admin menu` go to *Structure > Content types*

2. Click *edit* next to the content type that you want to enable weight settings for (e.g. *Taxon Description*)

3. Click ‘Weight Settings’’ from the bottom left menu

4. Select *YES* under *ENABLE* to activate weight settings for that content type

5. Click *Save content type*


Set weight
~~~~~~~~~~

Either *Add* or *Edit* an item of content for the node type on which you have enabled setting weight.

A new weight option is available in the node additional options.

Sticky at top of lists
----------------------

The *Sticky at top of lists* setting is a simpler setting to control node order. 
A node with *Sticky at top of lists* selected will appear at the top of all lists
in which it appears. 

For example, if you had multiple taxon descriptions for a single taxon and 
enabled *Sticky at top of lists* for one of these, it would be this one that 
appears on the taxon *Overview* page and would be first on the ‘Descriptions’’ page.

Set stickiness
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Stickiness is enabled by default on all node types, and is available under
publishing options on the :term:`Node` edit form.
