Publishing
==========

Items of content on *Scratchpads* can be either *Published* or *Unpublished*. Unpublished content is not viewable by members of the public and is a good method of creating drafts before publishing them.


Publishing options
------------------

Every content type has a publishing checkbox as part of the *Edit*/*Create* form.

2. Next to the content type, click the *Edit* link

3. In the *Publishing options* tab, change the *Default options*

Unpublished content
-------------------

Unpublished content will only be available to the author of the content; it will not be public on the site.

When viewing unpublished content the background will be coloured pink:
