Tracking new content
====================

Introduction
------------

Tracking all the new content of your site can be very useful, especially
if you are participating in a large Scratchpads community. The ‘tracker’
module allows you to generate a page that dynamically lists all the new
`nodes`_ in your site. It will also allow logged-in users to keep track
of the latest changes they made in the site.

Instructions
------------

Enabling the module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. From the `Admin menu`_ go to *Structure > Tools*
2. Find the section called *Core*
3. Enable the *Tracker* module
4. Click *Save*

Once the module is enabled a new link will appear at the footer of every
Scratchpads page titled ‘Recent content’’

-  *All recent content* tab would be displayed to all logged-in and
   anonymous users
-  *My recent content* tab will only be displayed to logged-in users of
   the site
