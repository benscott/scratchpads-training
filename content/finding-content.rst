Finding content
===============

There are several ways to find specific content on a Scratchpad: Search_, `Faceted search`_, :term:`Main menu` and :term:`Admin menu`.

Search
~~~~~~

The Search box in the header has different search options: *All* and *Taxonomy*. 

*All* finds all content that includes the search term.

*Taxonomy* only searches for terms in one of the vocabularies and
returns the matched terms. 

The search functionality is aware of the content type you're viewing: When you are viewing a page (“Page” content type) you will get an additional option to search only page content.

Clicking on the *Search* button when the search field is empty will lead to a faceted search page.

Faceted Search
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some pages provide the option of faceted search in a separate block on
the left of the page. Faceted search can be used to filter the nodes of
a content type (e.g. References) To use the faceted search:

-  Fields with less than 20 terms show up as a list. Click on a term to
   restrict results for this term

-  Fields with more than 20 terms also provide an auto-complete search
   box. Fill in the term and press enter or else select from the list

-  You can remove a filter by clicking on the (-) sign next to a
   selected term
-  You can filter the content based on multiple fields

Main menu
~~~~~~~~~

Click on one of the content types in the :term:`Main menu` to find the respective data. 

Several content types, like literature and media gallery offer :term:`faceted browsing` for smarter and more powerful searching.


Admin menu
~~~~~~~~~~

As maintainer of a site you can also find content via the :term:`Admin menu`.

-  Click on *Content* in the Admin menu and then on *View* next to the
   content type that included the data you need to find.

This way you can only find content by content type. The advantage is
that you can find content that is not published which is otherwise
difficult. Additionally, you can search by username or do operations
like deleting or (un)publishing several nodes at once.


Recent content
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also view all recent content - see :doc:`/content/recent-content`.
