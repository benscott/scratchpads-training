Media gallery
=============

*Media Galleries are used to organise Images or other media types in
groups. You may use media galleries to organise your media thematically
according to the your needs.*

1. From the :term:`Admin menu` go to *Content > Media gallery*

2. Click *+ media gallery*

3. Enter a *TITLE* and a short description of the gallery in the *BODY*
   field

4. In the *Media box* click on *Select media* and either upload a new
   image or, if you already uploaded images, click on the *Library* tab
   and select the image(s) you want to link to this media gallery

   .. only:: training

        Some example images are included in the course :ref:`training-material`.

5. Click *Submit*

6. To change the creative commons license (the default licence is the
   one you chose during the set up workflow) or annotate your image in
   other ways (taxonomic name, imaging technique, keywords, etc.) click
   on *Edit media* next to the respective image.

   If you upload several images, it is faster to use the :term:`Grid editor` to edit several images
   at once (see :doc:`/content/editing-content`)
