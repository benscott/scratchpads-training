   and select the image(s) you want to link to this media gallery

6. To change the creative commons license (the default licence is the
   one you chose during the set up workflow) or annotate your image in
   other ways (taxonomic name, imaging technique, keywords, etc.) click
   on *Edit media* next to the respective image. If you upload several
   images, it is faster to use the `Grid editor`_ to edit several images
   at once (see `Edit content`_)

7. To add another image click the *Add another item* button and select
   another media file.

8. Click *Save*

9. After saving you will see your media gallery but the images will
   still be missing. Renew your browser page (Control+F5 on a PC) after
   a couple minutes to make the images appear.
