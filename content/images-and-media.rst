Editing metadata
----------------

If you want to set image metadata (e.g. title, media gallery or taxonomic name), you will need to edit the image.

1. From the :term:`Admin menu` go to *Content*

2. Select *Image*

3. Find the uploaded image, and click *Edit*

4. Change the *TITLE* if necessary and fill in the other fields as needed.

    .. figure:: /_static/EditImage2.jpg

5. To link the image to the classification and have it show on taxon pages enter a name in the *TAXONOMIC NAME* field. After typing a few letters you will get a list of names starting with these letters. Choose one of these.

  .. only:: training 

    For the training course, please tag the images from your :ref:`training-material` with the appropriate taxa (based on the file name)


6. Click on the *Misc* vertical tab. Fill the *Media Gallery* you wish your image(s) to belong to

7. Click *Save*




If you upload several images, it is faster to use the :term:`Grid editor` to edit several images at once (see :doc:`/content/editing-content`)
