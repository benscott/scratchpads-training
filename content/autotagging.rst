Autotagging
===========

Once you have added terms to a biological classification, new content
will be automatically tagged to the classification by default. This is
called autotagging. The system will look for the presence of terms in
the text and if it finds a term it will add a link to this term to the
:term:`node`. 



Autotagging can be problematic because if names of other taxa
are mentioned in the text, for example while comparing characters, then
these will be tagged, too. For some content types like taxon
descriptions or images, this can be undesirable. The other problem is
that species names will automatically be tagged to the genus name as
well as the species name because both are part of the name. But for
example a species description should only be linked to the respective
species.
