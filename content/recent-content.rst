Recent content
==============

*Tracking all the new content of your site can be very useful, especially if you are participating in a large Scratchpads community.* 

*The ‘tracker’ module allows users to keep track of the latest changes they made in the site.*


Enabling the module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. From the :term:`Admin menu` go to *Structure > Tools*
2. Find the section called *Core*
3. Enable the *Tracker* module
4. Click *Save*

Track new content
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once the module is enabled a new "*Track*" tab will appear on every user profile page. Click the tab to view a list of all content created by that user.


Dashboard
~~~~~~~~~

Your Dashboard also provides a view of all recent content added to a Scratchpad.

Click on :term:`Dashboard` in the :term:`Admin menu`. 

This dashboard can be customised to display other useful information - see :doc:`/other/customise-dashboard`.
