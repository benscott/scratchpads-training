communicating with the users of a Scratchpad.*

The *Blogs* tab shows the blog entries from all users. You can filter by user using the facets in the left hand column. You can also filter blog posts by clicking on the link to *this users blog* available at the bottom of a  blog entry. Alternatively go the the userâ€™s account and use
the link there.
