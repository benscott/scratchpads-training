Google analytics
================

*Google Analytics helps you get an overview over the number of visitors
on your site, where they come from and how they behave.*

1. Go to http://www.google.com/analytics/features/index.html and create
   a Google Analytics account for your Scratchpad. You will be given a
   key that starts with “UA-”. Save this key or keep this page open
   while you enable the Google Analytics module on your Scratchpad.

2. In the :term:`Admin menu` go to *Structure > Tools*.

3. Under the *Statistics* section enable Google Analytics and save.

4. Configure the Google Analytics tool by clicking on the *Configure
   Google Analytics* link that has appeared in the *Statistics* section.
   Alternatively go to *Configuration* in the :term:`Admin menu` and click on
   *Google Analytics*.

5. In the WEB PROPERTY ID field enter the enter the UA number given by Google when you signed up. 

6. *Save configuration*

7. After about a day you should be able to see the first data about your
   Scratchpad when you log into your Google Analytics account. You can
   only view these data via your Analytics account, not via your
   Scratchpad.
