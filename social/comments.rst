Managing comments
=================

The commenting functionality in Scratchpads is a valuable system that
enables registered and/or anonymous users to comment on a piece of
content (usually a :term:`node`). Maintainers and editors of a site can
control the comment functionality per content type and per user role.
This means that a Scratchpad site might have comments enabled for a
content type (e.g. taxon descriptions) but not for another content type
(e.g. specimens/observations).

Maintainers can change the roles that are permitted to submit comments
to a site.

2. Under *Comment* select the user groups, according to their roles,
   that you wish to be able to post comments

3. If *anonymous users* are selected. Visitors of the site will be able
   to submit comments to be published. By default comments by anonymous
   users need the maintainerâ€™s approval before published in the site
