Exporting to geocat
===================

`GeoCAT`_ is designed to produce rapid species level conservation
assessments based on IUCN Red List Categories and Criteria (IUCN 2001).

You can use Scratchpads to import the occurrence data for the specimens
of a taxon directly to `GeoCAT`_. This will allow you to directly run a
rapid species level conservation assessment.

Through an easy to use interface with a familiar Google Map underlay,
you can upload primary occurrence data for a species and at the click of
a button, calculate values relating to the geographic range of a
species.

1. Go to the species overview page for the selected species
2. Click on the *specimens* tab
3. Click on the *Import into GeoCAT* link at the bottom of the specimens
   table
