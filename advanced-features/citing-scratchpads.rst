Citing Scratchpads
==================

Scratchpads are a dynamic environment. Site maintainers, editors and
contributors can modify the contents of a page at any point. However, as
Scratchpads are being used as a source for information in scientific
journals and other online resources it is necessary for a visitor to be
able to capture the information provided in a page and be able to access
this page at any point in time, even when the contents of the page have
been modified at a later date.

The *Cite this page* functionality allows visitors to generate a
snapshot of the page they visit that is being deposited in a separate
secure Scratchpad server with a unique and stable URL. The stored
snapshots will remain accessible even if the original source is no
longer available.


Enabling the module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. From the :term:`Admin menu` go to *Structure > Tools*

2. Enable the *Scratchpads Cite this page* tool under the *Sharing*
   section

3. Click *Save*


Using the tool
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This functionality, once enabled, is available to all registered and
anonymous users of the site. Once enabled a *Cite me* button will be
available to all pages in a site that have content that can be cited.
