Customise front page
====================

Click on the *Home* icon to go to the front page. 


Welcome title & message
-----------------------

As part of the set-up workflow you will already have produced a welcome message for your front page.

1. To change this, click *Edit*.

2. In *Welcome message* enter the text you want to display

3. By default, the title will be *Welcome to Scratchpad training site*. You can change this by selecting *Override welcome title* and entering your new title. 


Images
------

To the right of the welcome message is an image block. If you havenâ€™t added any images, yet, this space will be empty. (See :doc:`/content/images-and-media`). The image block consists of four thumbnails and one larger image. The
larger image changes to the image the mouse hovers over.

You can select which images to display on the home page by:

1. Under :term:`Admin menu` go to *Content > Image*

2. Locate the image you wish to use, and click *Edit*

3. Select the option *Promote to home page*


If you would prefer to display a list of content rather than images:

1. On the home page select *Edit*.

2. In the *Main block* section, select *Content*

3. Select the content type to display

4. Select *Save configuration*


Content blocks
--------------

The home page also display three blocks of recent content - by default these blocks will show *Page*, *Biblio*, and
*Taxon description*.

You can choose different content to display in these blocks.

1. On the home page select *Edit*.

2. In the *Small blocks* section, select which content type to show in each of the three blocks.
