Formatting thumbnails
=====================

By default, thumbnail images on a Scratchpad are resized and cropped to fit an 85x85 pixel frame.

This provides a clean and easy way to browse thumbnail gallery - but does have the drawback that some image content will be missing from the thumbnail.  

If this is a problem for your Scratchpad you can enable the *Full thumbnails* option which will display a miniature version of the entire image without cropping.

To enable *Full thumbnails*:

1. From the :term:`Admin menu` go to *Structure > Tools*
2. Go to section *Images*
3. Turn the *Full thumbnails* on
4. Click *Save*
