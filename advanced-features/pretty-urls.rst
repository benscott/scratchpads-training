Enable pretty URLs
==================

Enabling *Pretty URLs* generates user-friendly URL aliases, based on the
title of the content being edited/created. 

For example, a page titled “About this site” will be accessible under the URL *about-this-site*, 
not just *node/x*. This also might help your pages rank high in search engine results. 

To enable *Pretty URLs* on your Scratchpad:

1. In the :term:`Admin menu` go to *Structure > Tools*. 

2. In the *Other* section enable *Pretty URLs*

3. Click *Save*.

2. In the *Search and metadata* section, select "URL aliases"

3. Select the *Bulk update* tab.

4. Select the content types you want to to generate URLs for.
