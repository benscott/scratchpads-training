Custom content type on taxon page
=================================


If you have a new content type you'd like displayed on the classification taxon page:

1. In the :term:`Admin menu` go to *Structure > Content types*

2. Click *Edit* for the content type you want to display

3. Click on the *Display settings* tab near the bottom of the page and check *Display on species page*. 

4. A new set of options appear in which you can check where the block is supposed to appear. It can either appear on its own tab or under one of the existing tabs. Select one option.

5. Click *Save*

TIP: The content type must have a taxonomic name field corresponding to the classification species page.
