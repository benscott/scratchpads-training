### Introduction

To change how the block of a certain content type is showing on the taxon pages you need to edit the respective content type.

-   Go to Structure in the [Admin menu](glossary-glossary-adminmenu) and click on Content types.
-   Click on edit for the content type you want to change.
-   Click on the Display settings tab near the bottom of the page and check Display on species page. A new set of options appear in which you can check where the block is supposed to appear. It can either appear on its own tab or under one of the existing tabs. Select one option and save the content type.
