Enable pretty urls
==================

Pretty URLs generates user-friendly aliases (Pretty URLs) based on the
title of the content being edited/created. For exmaple, a page titled
“About this site” will be given the URL content/about-this-site, instead
of node/x.

Instructions
------------

1. To enable Pretty URLs on your Scratchpad go to *Structure* in the
   :term:`Admin menu` and click on *Tools*. In the *Other* section enable
   Pretty URLs and save.
2. Once enabled you can manually alter or bulk update URL aliases and
   redirects from *Configuration* in the :term:`Admin menu` under the *Search
   and metadata* section
