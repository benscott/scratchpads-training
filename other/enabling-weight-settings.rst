Enabling weight settings on content types
=========================================

Introduction
------------

The weight settings allow you to finely control the order of content.
For example, if you have many taxon descriptions, you may want to
control the order that they appear on the *Descriptions* tab on a taxon
page.

In many cases using the *Sticky at top of lists* setting will be
sufficient to control which node appears first. For example, if you had
multiple taxon descriptions for a single taxon and enabled *Sticky at
top of lists* for one of these, it would be this one that appears on the
taxon *Overview* page and would be first on the ‘Descriptions’’ page.

Instructions
------------

1. From the Admin menu go to *Structure* then *Content types*

2. Click *edit* next to the content type that you want to enable weight settings for (e.g. *Taxon Description*)

3. Click ‘Weight Settings’’ from the bottom left menu

4. Select *YES* under *ENABLE* to activate weight settings for that content type

5. Click *Save content type*
