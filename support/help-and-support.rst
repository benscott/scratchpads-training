Help and support
================

If you have any issues with your Scratchpad, require any assistance, or would like to request a new feature, please use our `Issue Queue`_. You will need to sign up for a user account on Github.

To make it easier to view and post new issues, you can do so from within your Scratchpad using the issue tab (no Github account required). This appears on the left hand side of your Scratchpad when you are logged in.

If you have specific questions or would like advice or help in how to
best set up your site, please email the Scratchpad team at
scratchpad@nhm.ac.uk. 

Don’t be afraid to ask ‘stupid’ questions and don’t get hung up on a 
problem for hours. If you are having an issue it's very likely others will have
the same issue. By asking the question you're helping the community and it will often
lead to us fixing a bug or improving our documentation.
