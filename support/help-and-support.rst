Help and support
================

Help and tips for working with Scratchpads can be found on the help wiki
at http://help.scratchpads.eu

For feature requests and bug reports please use the Issues tab which
appears on the left hand side of your Scratchpad when you are logged in.
If you have specific questions or would like advice or help in how to
best set up your site, please email the Scratchpad team at
scratchpad@nhm.ac.uk. Don’t be afraid to ask ‘stupid’ questions and
don’t get hung up on a problem for hours. In some cases the solution
might be easy (you just have to know it…) in others it might be a bug
only our programmer can solve.
