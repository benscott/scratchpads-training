What makes a good logo?
-----------------------

It's not easy to design a custom logo. Some guidelines to consider:

- Try to keep it relatively small so the header area is not too big. The header appears on every page and site content is displayed below the header.

- The dimensions of the default Scratchpad logo are 71x70 pixels. We do not recommend creating a logo over 130 pixels high.

-  The ideal file format is `Portable Network Graphics (PNG)`_ as it
   supports transparency, something that JPEGs do not. If your header
   image/logo does not require transparent areas then a JPEG is fine to
   use.
-  We create logos as `vector images`_ then save them as `raster
   images`_.
