Adding & editing users
======================

You can control user access under *People* in the :term:`Admin menu`. The
*People* page allows you to list all users of your site and perform
actions (upgrade, delete, edit) on them.

There are five user :term:`roles`:

-  **Anonymous** A non-logged in user.

-  **Authenticated** (unblocked) user: Able to access non-public
   content, create and edit own forum posts

-  **Contributor**: Able to create content and edit own content

-  **Editor**: Able to create and edit own content, and also edit other
   people’s content

-  **Maintainer**: Like editor, but also has administration privileges

Authorising new user accounts

email and will have to unblock them and add a user role before they can
use the site.

2. Check the status and role of the user(s) you want to edit. Newly
   signed up users will have a status of “blocked”
3. Click the check box to the left of their username and select “Unblock
   the selected users” then click *Update*
