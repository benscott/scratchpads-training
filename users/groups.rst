Groups
======

*Let’s assume you want to prepare data for a publication online, but you
don’t want anybody to see these data, yet, except for yourself and maybe
some co-authors. The best way to do this is by using a “Group”.*

*Groups are private areas on a Scratchpad which are only accessible to
group members. A user can have a higher user role within a group. For
example someone who is contributor to the main Scratchpad can be
administrator for a group and edit group content created by other group
members.*

*Content generated within a group can be publicly visible or
hidden. The creator of a group is usually responsible for managing the
group and its users, but he/she can give other users administrative
rights.*

Enabling the Group module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you can add a group you need to enable the Group module.

1. From the :term:`Admin menu` go to *Structure > Tools*
2. In the *Groups* section turn the Group module *On*
3. Click *Save*
4. If a message appears that you need to rebuild the content access
   permissions, click on the *Rebuild permissions* link and rebuild.
5. Go to the front page. A new menu item called *Group content* will
   appear in the Main menu. As long as there are no groups, the *Group
   content* page will show all the content on the site. In addition to
   the new menu item, new fields related to groups will appear when you
   add or edit content.

Adding a new group
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. From the :term:`Admin menu` click *Content* and then *Add* link for Group

2. Enter a *GROUP NAME*

3. In the *BODY* field you can enter a short description of the group
   that will be visible to users on general group pages

4. Select *Group visibility* - Public or private

5. Click *Save*

After saving you will see the main groups page which will show
content linked to this group. It takes up to an hour for the Group
name to actually show on this page and you will need to refresh the
page to actually see it. However, you can already link content to the
group or add members.

Add group members
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. *Edit* the group

2. Select the *Members* tab.

3. Click the *Add people* link.

2. Enter the USER NAME and click the button.

A user’s role is the same within a group as it is on the rest of the
Scratchpad and the only option is to give a member the “administrator
member” role, which can be done on the page. Administrator members
can edit the group and manage the subscriptions.

Adding content to the group
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Add a new page
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    .. figure:: /_static/AddGroupPage.jpg

1. In the *GROUPS AUDIENCE* box select the new group

2. In the *GROUP CONTENT VISIBILITY* drop down menu select *Private -
   accessible only to group members*. Group content can also be public
   or use the default. The default is on public and this can only be
   changed by members of the Scratchpad team.

3. Click *Save*

You are now viewing your private group page. Note that the menu item
linking to this page is visible and the page also pops up in the
*Recent pages* block on the front page.

When logged out the menu item disappears and the page is not cited in
the *Recent pages* block on the front page any more. The page itself
gives an “Access denied” message (after refreshing the browser window
with Control+F5).
