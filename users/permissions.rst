Permissions
===========

*Scratchpads let you control what features people can access on your site.*

You can access the permissions from :term:`Admin menu` go to *People > permissions*. Permissions can be set for each of the five user :term:`roles`:

-  **Anonymous** A non-logged in user.

-  **Authenticated** (unblocked) user: Able to access non-public
   content, create and edit own forum posts

-  **Contributor**: Able to create content and edit own content

-  **Editor**: Able to create and edit own content, and also edit other
   peopleâ€™s content

-  **Maintainer**: Like editor, but also has administration privileges

Comments
--------

By default, only users with an account (non-Anonymous) can create comments.

You can change this by checking the *anonymous user* option in the *Post comments* permission.


Node revisions
--------------

Node revisions are only viewable by the content authors, but you can grant other roles access to view the changes.
