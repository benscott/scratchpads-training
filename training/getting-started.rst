*Introduction to Scratchpad training course*

The Scratchpad training course focuses on creating and setting up a new site, adding various kinds of data and generating taxon pages.

The goal is to give an overview of what a Scratchpad can do and enable you to independently explore your Scratchpad after the event. By the end of the course you should be able to: 

- Customise your site including the front page 
- Add and edit biological classifications (manually and through import services) 
- Add taxon descriptions and images to create taxon pages 
- Import and manage your bibliography 
- Find your content using different search methods 
- Administer site users 
- Control and explore site functionality with site tools 

For the purposes of the training courses each participant will be assigned a temporary training site to work with. Your trainer will provide your training site address. 

The training sites will be available to the participants for two weeks after the training course. After this period all temporary training courses will be erased.  If at the end of the course you'd like your site to become a standard Scratchpad, please send an email to scratchpads@nhm.ac.uk and we will arrange it for you. 

To apply for a normal Scratchpads site please use the appropriate form located at http://get.scratchpads.eu.
