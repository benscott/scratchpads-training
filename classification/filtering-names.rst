Filtering taxonomic terms
=========================

*You can use filters to temporarily ‘clean’ a classification from
unwanted terms. Some biological classifications include a lot of
synonyms, often multiple times the volume of accepted names.*

*You may want to allow for users to temporarily browse only through the
accepted terms of a taxonomy. You can also allow the exclusion of terms
based on the rank they belong or the unacceptability reason.*

1. While on the desired classification browsing page, click on the cog on the left top corner of the taxonomic tree (left side bar)

2. Select *Configure block*

3. Adjust the settings under the *Toggle visibility of terms* section as
   follows:

        - Select the *Field to match against*. E.g. select *usage* if you want to add a filter to exclude all not accepted terms

        - Select the *Values to hide*. E.g. select *not accepted* if you want to add a filter to exclude all not accepted terms
