Enabling blocks
===============

1. In the :term:`Admin menu` go to *Structure > Blocks*

2.  Scroll the page to find the Block you wish to enable.

3.  Click on the *Configure* link

4.  If needed, you can give a title for your block. This will replace the default title.

5.  In the region settings select where you wish your block to appear:

    -  Select *Sidebar* if you wish the block to be visible as a right
       sidebar in one or more of your pages

    -  Select *Footer* if you wish the block to be visible in the footer
       area in one or more of your pages

    -  Select *Menu* if you wish the block to be visible in menu in one
       or more of your pages. Note: this option will not work with all Blocks.

    -  Select *Main content* if you wish the block to be visible in the 
       main content section of the page. 


    .. only:: training
        
       For the "Species subordinate taxa" block created in 
       the :doc:`/views-and-blocks/views-block` tutorial select "Main content"

6.  From the *Pages* tab select on which pages you wish the block to appear/be excluded from.

    You can target the pages by writing the paths, with multiple paths per line. 

    .. only:: training
        
       For the "Species subordinate taxa" block we want it to display on all pages (the
       contextual filter within the view will handle hiding the view on non classification
       pages). To do so select *All pages except those listed* and leave the path input empty.

7. Click *Save block*

.. only:: training

    If you visit one of the classification species pages you can now view the subordinate taxa block.



Additional options
------------------

- Rather than specifying page paths to display the block on, you can set the block to be visible on certain content type pages.

- Under *Roles* you can also restrict viewing the block to uses with a specific role.

- Select *Display as Tab* in the *Tabify the Block* tab if you wish the content of the block to appear as a sidescreen tab (like the issues queue tab)
